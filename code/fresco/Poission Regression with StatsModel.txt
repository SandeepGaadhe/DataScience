Poisson Model Example
Poisson Model describes a process where dependent variable refers to success count of many attempts and each attempt has a very low probability of success.

Let's understand how to fit a Poisson regression model for a data set available at UCLA repository.

The dataset contains details of a number of awards earned, type of program enrolled, and score obtained in final math exam by students at a high school.



Loading the Dataset
The dataset is fetched as a pandas data frame as shown below.
import pandas as pd

awards_df = pd.read_csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/poisson_sim.csv")

print(awards_df.head(3))
Output
    id  num_awards  prog  math
0   45           0     3    41
1  108           0     1    41
2   15           0     3    44
There are three type of programs enrolled by a student : 1 - "General", 2 - "Academic", 3 - "Vocational"



Creating the Model
Now let's create a Poisson model with the patsy formula num_awards ~ math + C(prog).
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

poisson_model = smf.poisson('num_awards ~ math + C(prog)', awards_df)
Fitting the Model
poisson_model_result = poisson_model.fit()




Viewing Model Summary
Viewing Model Summary
Model summary is viewed using code, poisson_model_result.summary().



Analyzing Model Summary
The coefficient for math variable is 0.07, which means for every one unit increase in math, the log count increases by 0.07.

Having enrolled for prog=2, i.e., "Academic", instead of "Generic" program, changes the log count by 1.08.

Having enrolled for prog=3, i.e., "Vocational", instead of "Generic" program, changes the log count by 0.37.
