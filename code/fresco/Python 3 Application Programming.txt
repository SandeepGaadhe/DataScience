Working with Files
How to handle data in a file?

Data from an opened file can be read using any of the methods: read, readline and readlines.

Data can be written to a file using either write or writelines method.

A file must be opened, before it is used for reading or writing.

Example: Reading a file

fp = open('temp.txt', 'r')   # opening
content = fp.read()          # reading
fp.close()                   # closing







Regular expressions are patterns that help in filtering the text possessing them, and also in extracting portions of data that match the patterns, for further use.

The patterns are built using special characters.

Python uses re package to deal with regular expressions.

Example

import re
pattern='for'
text='information'
if re.search(pattern, text):
    print('Yes')
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Python Database API
How to connect to Python database?

Python Database API (DB-API) is a standard interface to interact with various databases.

DB-API supports connecting to different database servers such as Microsoft SQL Server 2000, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

Different DB API’s are used for accessing different databases. Hence a programmer has to install DB API corresponding to the database one is working with.
















Working with a Database
Working with a database includes the following steps:

Importing the corresponding DB-API module.

Acquiring a connection with the database.

Executing SQL statements and stored procedures.

Closing the connection






Creating Tables
You have connected to the database. Now, how do you create your tables in the database?

In this topic, you will learn using sqlite3, DB API for SQLite database.

sqlite3 is available by default in Python standard library and hence there is no need of installing it separately.

SQLite is a very lightweight database. You can connect to it directly, with minimal settings.


Creating a Sample Table
Example 1

import sqlite3
# establishing  a database connection
con = sqlite3.connect('D:\\TEST.db')
# preparing a cursor object
cursor = con.cursor()
# preparing sql statements
sql1 = 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS EMPLOYEE'


Creating a Sample Table...
Example 1...

sql2 = '''

       CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
       EMPID INT(6) NOT NULL,
       NAME CHAR(20) NOT NULL,
       AGE INT,
       SEX CHAR(1),
       INCOME FLOAT
       )
      '''

# executing sql statements
cursor.execute(sql1)
cursor.execute(sql2)

# closing the connection
con.close()







nserting Data
Have you created your table? Now, let us learn how to insert data into the table.

Data stored in Python variables can be inserted into database tables.

Data is passed to SQL statements through parameter substitution.

Single rows are inserted using execute and multiple rows using executeMany method of created cursor object.












nserting a Sample Data
Example 1

import sqlite3
# establishing the connection
con = sqlite3.connect('D:\\TEST.db')
# preparing a cursor object
cursor = con.cursor()
# preparing sql statement
rec = (456789, 'Frodo', 45, 'M', 100000.00)
sql = '''
      INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
      '''
      
      
      
      
      
      
Inserting a Sample Data...
Example 1...


# executing sql statement using try ... except blocks

try:

    cursor.execute(sql, rec)

    con.commit()

except Exception as e:

    print("Error Message :", str(e))

    con.rollback()



# closing the database connection

con.close()

A single record is inserted into table EMPLOYEE.









Inserting a Sample Data...
Example 2


import sqlite3



con = sqlite3.connect('D:\\TEST.db')



cursor = con.cursor()



# preparing sql statement

records = [

    (123456, 'John', 25, 'M', 50000.00),

    (234651, 'Juli', 35, 'F', 75000.00),

    (345121, 'Fred', 48, 'M', 125000.00),

    (562412, 'Rosy', 28, 'F', 52000.00)

    ]

sql = '''

       INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES ( ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

      '''
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
Inserting a Sample Data...
Example 2...


# executing sql statement using try ... except blocks

try:

    cursor.executemany(sql, records)

    con.commit()

except Exception as e:

    print("Error Message :", str(e))

    con.rollback()



# closing the database connection

con.close()

Four more records are inserted into table EMPLOYEE.












Fetching Data
After executing the SQL statement for reading records from a table, either of the following methods can be used to retrieve them in python.

fetchone: It retrieves one record at a time in the form of a tuple.

fetchall: It retrieves all fetched records at a point in the form of tuple of tuples.










Fetching Sample Data
Example 1

import sqlite3
# establishing the connection
con = sqlite3.connect('D:\\TEST.db')
# preparing a cursor object
cursor = con.cursor()
# preparing sql statement
sql = '''
       SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
      '''
# executing the sql statement using `try ... except`
try:
    cursor.execute(sql)
except:
    print('Unable to fetch data.')
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Fetching Sample Data...
Example 1...


# fetching the records

records = cursor.fetchall()



# Displaying the records

for record in records:

    print(record)



# closing the connection

con.close()

The above example fetches and displays all five records inserted into EMPLOYEE.

Similarly, you can perform updating or delete records by preparing required SQL statements.


Object Relational Mappers
An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are adopted in application code.

ORMs offer a high-level abstraction upon a relational database, which permits a developer to write Python code rather than SQL to create, read, update and delete data and schemas in their database.





Sample ORM Query
Consider the sample SQL statement used to retrieve employees whose income is 10,000.00.

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE INCOME=10000.00

The equivalent Django ORM query is

emps = Employee.objects.filter(income=10000.00)

The above code is written in Python and easy to read.

Such an ability to write Python code instead of SQL speeds up web application development











Higher Order Functions
Higher Order Functions
Hope you have understood from the previous course Functions and OOPs, what is a function? Now, let us understand what is a higher order function.

A Higher Order function is a function, which is capable of doing any one of the following things:

It can be functioned as a data and be assigned to a variable.

It can accept any other function as an argument.

It can return a function as its result.

The ability to build Higher order functions, allows a programmer to create Closures, which in turn are used to create Decorators.






Function as a Data
Example
def greet():
    return 'Hello Everyone!'
print(greet())
wish = greet        # 'greet' function assigned to variable 'wish'
print(type(wish))   
print(wish())      
Output
Hello Everyone!
<type 'function'>
Hello Everyone!







Function as an Argument
Example
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
def sub(x, y):
   return x - y
def prod(x, y):
    return x * y
def do(func, x, y):
   return func(x, y)
print(do(add, 12, 4))  # 'add' as arg
print(do(sub, 12, 4))  # 'sub' as arg
print(do(prod, 12, 4))  # 'prod' as arg
output
16
8
48


Returning a Function
Example

def outer():

    def inner():

        s = 'Hello world!'

        return s            

        

    return inner()    



print(outer())

output

Hello world!

You can observe from the output that the return value of 'outer' function is the return value of 'inner' function i.e 'Hello world!'.










Returning a Function
Example

def outer():

    def inner():

        s = 'Hello world!'

        return s            

        

    return inner   # Removed '()' to return 'inner' function itself

    

print(outer()) #returns 'inner' function

func = outer() 

print(type(func))

print(func()) # calling 'inner' function

output

<function inner at 0xxxxxx>

<type 'function'>

Hello world!

Parenthesis after the inner function are removed so that the outer function returns inner function.










Closures
In simplest terms, a Closure is a function returned by a higher order function, whose return value depends on the data associated with the higher order function.

Example
def multiple_of(x):
    def multiple(y):
        return x*y
    return multiple
c1 = multiple_of(5)  # 'c1' is a closure
c2 = multiple_of(6)  # 'c2' is a closure
print(c1(4))
print(c2(4))










Closures...
Example

You can observe from the example that the closure functions c1 and c2 hold the data passed to enclosing function, multiple_of, during their creation.

The first closure function, c1 binds the value 5 to argument x and when called with an argument 4, it executes the body of multiple function and returns the product of 5 and 4.

Similarly c2 binds the value 6 to argument x and when called with argument 4 returns 24.

output

20

24













Decorators
Decorators
Decorators are evolved from the concept of closures.

A decorator function is a higher order function that takes a function as an argument and returns the inner function.

A decorator is capable of adding extra functionality to an existing function, without altering it.

The decorator function is prefixed with @ symbol and written above the function definition.



Decorators...
Consider the following three examples:

First one shows the creation of closure function wish using the higher order function outer.

The second one shows the creation of decorator function outer, which is used to decorate function greet. This is achieved with a small change to Example1.

Third one displays decorating the greet function with decorator function, outer, using @ symbol.




Decorator Examples
Example 1

def outer(func):
    def inner():
        print("Accessing :", 
                  func.__name__)
        return func()
    return inner
def greet():
   print('Hello!')
wish = outer(greet)
wish()
wish is the closure function obtained by calling an outer function with the argument greet.

When wish function is called, inner function gets executed.

Output
Accessing : greet
Hello!




Decorator Examples...
Example 2

def outer(func):
   def inner():
        print("Accessing :", 
                  func.__name__)
        return func()
    return inner
def greet():
   return 'Hello!'
greet = outer(greet) # decorating 'greet'
greet()  # calling new 'greet'
Output
Accessing : greet
The function returned by outer is assigned to greet i.e the function name passed as argument to outer.

This makes outer a decorator to greet.











Decorator Examples...
In Python, decorating a function can also be achieved by writing decorator function name, prefixed with @ symbol, just above the function to be decorated.

Hence, greet = outer(greet) expression is same as @outer.

Example 3

def outer(func):
    def inner():
        print("Accessing :", 
                func.__name__)
        return func()
    return inner
@outer
def greet():
    return 'Hello!'
greet()
Output

Accessing : greet













Descriptors
Python descriptors allow a programmer to create managed attributes.

In other object-oriented languages, you will find getter and setter methods to manage attributes.

However, Python allows a programmer to manage the attributes simply with the attribute name, without losing their protection.

This is achieved by defining a descriptor class, that implements any of __get__, __set__, __delete__ methods.








Descriptors - Example
Example 1

class EmpNameDescriptor:
    def __get__(self, obj, owner):
        return self.__empname
    def __set__(self, obj, value):
        if not isinstance(value, str):
            raise TypeError("'empname' must be a string.")
        self.__empname = value
The descriptor, EmpNameDescriptor is defined to manage empname attribute.

It checks if the value of empname attribute is a string or not.





Descriptors - Example...
Example 1...

class EmpIdDescriptor:
    def __get__(self, obj, owner):
        return self.__empid
    def __set__(self, obj, value):
        if hasattr(obj, 'empid'):
            raise ValueError("'empid' is read only attribute")
        if not isinstance(value, int):
            raise TypeError("'empid' must be an integer.")
        self.__empid = value
The descriptor, EmpIdDescriptor is defined to manage empid attribute.




Descriptors - Example...
Example 1...

class Employee:
    empid = EmpIdDescriptor()           
    empname = EmpNameDescriptor()       
    def __init__(self, emp_id, emp_name):
        self.empid = emp_id
        self.empname = emp_name
Employee class is defined such that, it creates empid and empname attributes from descriptors EmpIdDescriptor and EmpNameDescriptor.



Descriptors - Example...
Example 1...

e1 = Employee(123456, 'John')
print(e1.empid, '-', e1.empname)  
e1.empname = 'Williams'
print(e1.empid, '-', e1.empname)
e1.empid = 76347322  
You can observe that accessing attributes empid and empname appear as if you are accessing them directly.

However when executing the expression e1.empid = 76347322, the __set__ method defined in EmpIdDescriptor is executed and raises "ValueError: 'empid' is read only attribute".



Properties
Descriptors can also be created using property() type.

It is easy to create a descriptor for any attribute using property().

Syntax of defining a Property

property(fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None)

where,

fget : attribute get method

fset : attribute set method

fdel – attribute delete method

doc – docstring





Properties - Example
Example 1

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, emp_id, emp_name):
        self.empid = emp_id
        self.empname = emp_name
    def getEmpID(self):
        return self.__empid
    def setEmpID(self, value):
       if not isinstance(value, int):
            raise TypeError("'empid' must be an integer.")
        self.__empid = value
   empid = property(getEmpID, setEmpID)
empid attribute created using property.





Properties - Example...
Example 1...


    def getEmpName(self):

        return self.__empname



    def setEmpName(self, value):

        if not isinstance(value, str):

            raise TypeError("empname' must be a string.")

        self.__empname = value



    def delEmpName(self):

        del self.__empname



    empname = property(getEmpName, setEmpName, delEmpName)

empname attribute created using property. It is deleted when delEmpName method is called.





Properties - Example...
Example 1...


e1 = Employee(123456, 'John')

print(e1.empid, '-', e1.empname)    # -> '123456 - John'

del e1.empname    # Deletes 'empname'

print(e1.empname) #Raises 'AttributeError'

Output

123456 - John

AttributeError: ...

When del e1.empname is executed, it in turn calls delEmpName method.

Hence accessing empname attribute after the del expression results in AttributeError.





Property Decorators
Descriptors can also be created with property decorators.

While using property decorators, an attribute's get method will be same as its name and will be decorated with property.

In a case of defining any set or delete methods, they will be decorated with respective setter and deleter methods.


Property - Decorator...
Example 1

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, emp_id, emp_name):
        self.empid = emp_id
        self.empname = emp_name
    @property
    def empid(self):
        return self.__empid
    @empid.setter
    def empid(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, int):
            raise TypeError("'empid' must be an integer.")
        self.__empid = value
get and set methods of empid attribute are decorated with property.



Property - Decorator...
Example 1...

    @property
    def empname(self):
        return self.__empname
    @empname.setter
    def empname(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, str):
            raise TypeError("'empname' must be a string.")
        self.__empname = value
    @empname.deleter
    def empname(self):
        del self.__empname
get, set, and del methods of empname are decorated with property.



Property - Decorator...
Example 1...

e1 = Employee(123456, 'John')
print(e1.empid, '-', e1.empname)    # -> '123456 - John'
del e1.empname    # Deletes 'empname'
print(e1.empname) #Raises 'AttributeError'
Output
123456 - John
AttributeError : ...
deleter method corresponding to empname attribute is called when the expression, del e1.empname is executed.









Introduction to Class and Static Methods
Introduction to Class and Static Methods
You have read about function, higher order function, closures etc. Now, it is time to learn about their scope. Based on the scope, functions/methods are of two types. They are:

Class methods

Static methods



Class Methods
A method defined inside a class is bound to its object, by default.

However, if the method is bound to a Class, then it is known as classmethod.

Consider the following two examples:

Example 1 defines the method getCirclesCount, bound to an object of Circle class.

Example 2 defines the classmethod getCirclesCount, bound to class Circle.




class Circle(object):
    no_of_circles = 0
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius
        Circle.no_of_circles += 1
    def getCirclesCount(self):
        return Circle.no_of_circles
c1 = Circle(3.5)
c2 = Circle(5.2)
c3 = Circle(4.8)
print(c1.getCirclesCount())     # -> 3
print(c2.getCirclesCount())     # -> 3
print(Circle.getCirclesCount(c3)) # -> 3
print(Circle.getCirclesCount()) # -> TypeError


class Circle(object):
    no_of_circles = 0
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius
        Circle.no_of_circles += 1
    @classmethod
    def getCirclesCount(self):
        return Circle.no_of_circles
c1 = Circle(3.5)
c2 = Circle(5.2)
c3 = Circle(4.8)
print(c1.getCirclesCount())     # -> 3
print(c2.getCirclesCount())     # -> 3
print(Circle.getCirclesCount()) # -> 3




Static Method
A method defined inside a class and not bound to either a class or an object is known as Static Method.

Decorating a method using @staticmethod decorator makes it a static method.

Consider the following two examples:

Example1 defines the method square, outside the class definition of Circle, and uses it inside the class Circle.

Example2 defines the static method square, inside the class Circle, and uses it.



def square(x):
        return x**2
class Circle(object):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius
    def area(self):
        return 3.14*square(self.__radius)
c1 = Circle(3.9)
print(c1.area()) -> 47.7594
print(square(10)) -> 100

class Circle(object):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius
    @staticmethod
    def square(x):
        return x**2
    def area(self):
        return 3.14*self.square(self.__radius)
c1 = Circle(3.9)
print(c1.area())  
print(square(10)) # -> NameError


print(Circle.square(10)) # -> 100

print(c1.square(10))     # -> 100



Abstract Base Classes
Abstract Base Classes
An Abstract Base Class or ABC mandates the derived classes to implement specific methods from the base class.

It is not possible to create an object from a defined ABC class.

Creating objects of derived classes is possible only when derived classes override existing functionality of all abstract methods defined in an ABC class.



ABC - Example
In Python, an Abstract Base Class can be created using module abc.
Example 1

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass
In Example 1, Abstract base class Shape is defined with two abstract methods area and perimeter.




ABC - Example...
Example 1...

With existing abstract class definition of Shape, if you try creating a Shape object it results in TypeError.

s1 = Shape()

Output


TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Shape with abstract methods area, perimeter



ABC - Example...
Example 1...

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius
    @staticmethod
    def square(x):
        return x**2
    def area(self):
        return 3.14*self.square(self.__radius)
c1 = Circle(3.9)
Creating object c1, with out definingperimeter inside derived class, Circle, resulted in TypeError.
Output

TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Circle with abstract methods perimeter


ABC - Example...
Example 1...

Corrected class definition of Circle, that contains perimeter definition too.
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius
    @staticmethod
    def square(x):
        return x**2
    def area(self):
        return 3.14*self.square(self.__radius)
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2*3.14*self.__radius
c1 = Circle(3.9)
print(c1.area())
Output

47.7594



Context Manager
Context Manager
A Context Manager allows a programmer to perform required activities, automatically, while entering or exiting a Context.

For example, opening a file, doing few file operations, and closing the file is manged using Context Manager as shown below.


with open('sample.txt', 'w') as fp:

    content = fp.read()

The keyword with is used in Python to enable a context manager. It automatically takes care of closing the file.





Context Manager...
Consider the following example, which tries to establish a connection to a database, perform few db operations and finally close the connection.
Example 1

import sqlite3
try:
    dbConnection = sqlite3.connect('TEST.db')
    cursor = dbConnection.cursor()
    '''
    Few db operations
    ...
    '''
except Exception:
    print('No Connection.')
finally:
    dbConnection.close()

    
    
    
Context Manager...
Example 2

import sqlite3
class DbConnect(object):
    def __init__(self, dbname):
        self.dbname = dbname
    def __enter__(self):
        self.dbConnection = sqlite3.connect(self.dbname)
        return self.dbConnection
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.dbConnection.close()
with DbConnect('TEST.db') as db:
    cursor = db.cursor()
    '''
   Few db operations
   ...
    '''



Coroutines
Coroutines
A Coroutine is generator which is capable of constantly receiving input data, process input data and may or may not return any output.

Coroutines are majorly used to build better Data Processing Pipelines.

Similar to a generator, execution of a coroutine stops when it reaches yield statement.

A Coroutine uses send method to send any input value, which is captured by yield expression.
