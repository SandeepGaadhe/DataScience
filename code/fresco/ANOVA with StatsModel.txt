ANOVA Example

Let's now understand how to perform ANOVA of a fitted regression model.

For this example, let's once again consider popular Icecream dataset, used in linear regression section.

Loading the Dataset
import statsmodels.api as sm

icecream = sm.datasets.get_rdataset("Icecream", "Ecdat")
icecream_data = icecream.data



Building the Model
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

model1 = smf.ols('cons ~ temp', icecream_data).fit()
A linear regression model of icecream consumption with temperature is built using ols method.

Now let's frame a null hypothesis: Value of B1, i.e., the coefficient of temp variable is zero.


Creating ANOVA Table
anova_lm method from anova module of statsmodels library can be used for performing ANOVA.

from statsmodels.stats import anova
print(anova.anova_lm(model1))
Output
     df    sum_sq  mean_sq  F       P(>F)
temp 1.0   0.075   0.075    42.279  0.000
Resi 28.0  0.05    0.001    NaN     NaN
The obtained F-statistic is 42.27 and has a very low probability.

Hence, the null hypothesis can be rejected. i.e., B1 is not equal to zero.




Building New Model
Now let's create a new model with two independent variables and one response variable.

With more that one independent variable, the null hypothesis is stated as Coefficients of all independent variables are zero. i.e B1 = 0, and B2 = 0.

The alternative hypothesis will be that atleast one of the parameters Bj != 0 where j takes the values 1, 2, ...

model2 = smf.ols('cons ~ income + temp', icecream_data).fit()





Creating ANOVA Table
ANOVA table for model2 can be created as shown below.
print(anova.anova_lm(model2))
Output
        df   sum_sq  mean_sq F     PR(>F)
income  1.0  0.000   0.000   0.208 0.651
temp    1.0  0.087   0.087   63.41 0.000
Resi    27.0 0.037   0.001   NaN   NaN
The above table shows F-statistic corresponding to each independent variable.

Calculation of F-statistic for the model is shown in next slide.



Determining F-Value
F-statistic is defined as Mean square of model/Mean square of residuals.

Mean square of model is sum of squares values of all variables/degrees of freedom i.e (0.000288 + 0.087836)/2 = 0.044062.

Hence, the F-statistic of model is (0.044062 / 0.001385) = 31.813.

The probability of obtained F-statistic is 7.96*e-08 and is computed as shown below:

print(stats.f.sf(31.81, 2, 27))
Since the p-value is low, null hypothesis is rejected.



Comparing Two Models
ANOVA can also be used to compare two nested or related models.

model1 regresses consumption with temperature and model2 with temperature and income.

Below code verifies if the decrease in residuals sum of squares is significant or not.

print(anova.anova_lm(model1, model2))
Output
   df_r  ssr   df_diff ss_diff  F Pr(>F)
0  28.0  0.050 0.0  NaN    NaN    NaN
1  27.0  0.037 1.0  0.012  9.104  0.005
p-value i.e 0.005 from above table suggests the decrease in residual sum of squares in model2, compared to model1 is significant.
