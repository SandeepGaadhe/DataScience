Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis Testing is a methodology for evaluating if a claim is acceptable or not, based on data.

In a Hypothesis Testing, a Null Hypothesis (Ho) represents currently accepted the state of knowledge, and an Alternative Hypothesis (Ha) represents a new claim which challenges the currently accepted state of knowledge.

The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are mutually exclusive.






Steps Involved in Hypothesis Testing
The following steps are involved in a Hypothesis Testing:

Define the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.

Select a test statistics whose probability distribution function can be found under the null hypothesis.

Collect data.

Compute the test statistics from the data and calculate its p-value under the null hypothesis.

Null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is lower than predetermined significance value.





Choosing Test Statistics
In hypothesis testing, selecting a test statistics is the most difficult part.

The methods used for performing t-test are shown below.

stats.ttest_1samp: Tests if the mean of a population is a given value.
stats.ttest_ind: Tests if the means of two independent samples are equal.
stats.ttest_rel: Tests if the means of two paired samples are equal.




Example 1
Let's consider a common hypothesis: Mean of a population is equal to certain value.

In reality, we estimate mean and variance of a sample and calculate the test statistic.

If population variance is identified, then it is reasonable to consider that test statistic is normally distributed.

If population variance is unknown, sample variance is used, and test statistic follows t distribution.




Example 1
Consider a normal population with mean 0.8 and standard deviation 0.5.

Define the null hypothesis as Mean of the population is 1.0.

Let's calculate t-statistic and p-value

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

mu, sigma = 0.8, 0.5
X = stats.norm(mu, sigma)

# Deriving a sample
n = 100
X_sample = X.rvs(n)

# Computing test statistic
t, p = stats.ttest_1samp(X_sample, 1.0)
print(t, p)
Output
-4.99, 0.0000025

In previous example, the obtained t-statistic value is -4.99 and p-value is 0.0000025.

Since p-value is very low and less than the significance level 0.05, you can reject the null hypothesis and infer that the mean of the population is not 1.



Example 2
Let's consider another problem, where the null hypothesis states that the population means of two random variables are equal.

The below example derives two samples from different populations and verifies the claim that their population means are equal.

X1 = stats.norm(0.25, 1.0)
X2 = stats.norm(0.50, 1.0)

X1_sample = X1.rvs(100)
X2_sample = X2.rvs(100)

t, p = stats.ttest_ind(X1_sample, X2_sample)
print(t, p)
Output
-3.126  0.002

Example 2
In previous example, the obtained t-statistic value is -3.126 and p-value is 0.002.

Since p-value is very low and less than the significance level 0.05, you can reject the null hypothesis and state that population means of both samples differ.
